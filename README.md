# Posthaven Theme Strings

Posthave themes provide support for overriding internally generated stings (e.g. in the comment form). This repository contains an example strings file with all the current defaults.

## Usage

* Create a `config/strings.yml` file in your Posthaven theme
* Add overrides with the same keys as the [defaults.yml](defaults.yml) file in this repository.
